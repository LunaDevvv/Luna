# Luna
An AI Virtual assistant, using Discord and GODEL!

Finally got something to work, GODEL! 

After 5 hours of trying to get just a model downloaded, I finally got a model working with context and a character!

## I would use something from hugging face, but its being dumb
I have spent the past 3 hours just trying to download 1 model, and its not working at all.

## Python Character API
