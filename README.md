# Luna
An AI Virtual assistant, using Discord and GODEL!

Finally got something to work, GODEL! 

After 5 hours of trying to get just a model downloaded, I finally got a model working with context and a character!

## I would use something from hugging face, but its being dumb
I have spent the past 3 hours just trying to download 1 model, and its not working at all.

## Python Character API
[GODEL Web API](https://www.kaggle.com/code/shirodev/luna-web-api)

[Vicuna Web API](https://www.kaggle.com/shirodev/luna-web-api-for-vicuna)

***Do not use the vicuna instance. The discord bot is not set up for it, it uses too much ram, (even with the 30gb from cpu only), and if you use the old method it takes too much disk space.***

## Currently the character decides to be dumb, I am working on trying to fix that.
The discord side of things seems to work perfectly though.
